Chandan Sapkota, who one of my friend Bigyan calls the "Ezra Klein of Nepal", produces amazing analysis about Nepal, taking data sources from the obscure reports of government institutions and writing them up in blog posts. This project extends his ["Poverty by District in Nepal"](http://sapkotac.blogspot.com/2013/07/poverty-by-district-in-nepal.html) blog post, by maping maps of the data Chandan bar-charts for us.
